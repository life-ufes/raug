def get_augmentation (params=None, seed_number=None, verbose=False):
    """
    This function returns a bunch of transformation in order to use for augmentation in pytorch dataset pipeline. The
    transformation should be informed in params. All transformations are performed randomly

    :param params (optional, dictionary): a dictionary containing the following params:
    - prob (float): the probability to perform any augmentation. It should be a value between 0.0 and 1.0. If the key
    is not informed, the Default value is 0.5. Note: Even with prob = 0, resize and convert to tensor are performed.

    - size (int or tuple): a tuple of ints representing width and height to resize the image. If it's just a int, so
    width = height = int. Set it None to keep the original size. If the key is not informed, the default value is
    (128, 128).

    - brightness (float or tuple): how much to jitter brightness. This is chosen uniformly from [max(0, 1 - brightness),
    1 + brightness] or the given [min, max]. Should be non negative numbers. If the key is not informed, the Default
    value is 0.3

    - contrast (float or tuple): how much to jitter contrast. It's chosen uniformly from [max(0, 1 - contrast),
    1 + contrast] or the given [min, max]. Should be non negative numbers. If the key is not informed, the Default value
     is 0.4

    - saturation (float or tuple): how much to jitter saturation. It's chosen uniformly from [max(0, 1 - saturation),
    1 + saturation] or the given [min, max]. Should be non negative numbers. If the key is not informed, the Default
    value is 0.5

    - hue (float or tuple): how much to jitter hue. It's chosen uniformly from [-hue, hue] or the given [min, max].
    Should have 0<= hue <= 0.5 or -0.5 <= min <= max <= 0.5. If the key is not informed, the Default value is 0.05.

    - horizontal_flip (float): the probability to perform the flip. It should be 0 < p < 1. If 0 it means the flip will
    not be performed. If the key is not informed, the default value is 0.5

    - vertical_flip (float): the probability to perform the flip. It should be 0 < p < 1. If 0 it means the flip will
    not be performed. If the key is not informed, the default value is 0.5

    - rotation_degrees (float or int): range of degrees to perform a rotation. If degrees is a number instead of tuple,
     like (min, max), the range of degrees will be (-degrees, +degrees). Set to 0 to deactivate rotations. If the key
     is not informed, the default value is (-10, 10)

    - translate (tuple): tuple of maximum absolute fraction for horizontal and vertical translations. For example,
     translate=(a, b), then horizontal shift is randomly sampled in the range -img_width * a < dx < img_width * a
     and vertical shift is randomly sampled in the range -img_height * b < dy < img_height * b.  Set it None to not
     translate. If the key is not informed, the default value is (0, 0.1)

    - scale (tuple): scaling factor interval, e.g (a, b), then scale is randomly sampled from the range a <= scale <= b.
     Set it None to keep the original scale. If the key is not informed, the default value is (1,2)

    - shear (float or tuple): range of degrees to select from. If degrees is a number instead of sequence, like
    (min, max), the range of degrees will be (-degrees, +degrees). Set it None to not apply shear. If the key is not
    informed, the default value is (1,5)

    - noise (float): how much you'd like to apply random noise on the image. Set it None if you'd like to not include
    noise. The value should be <= 1.0. If the key is not informed, the default value is None.

    - blur (tuple): if you'd like to perform a blur in the image set a tuple containing the (kernel_size, std). If you
     don't wanna perform blur set it as None. If the key is not informed, the default value is None.

    If params is None, the default values of each param is used

    :param seed_number (int, optional): the seed number to keep the shuffle for multiples executions. Default is None.

    :param verbose(bool, optional): if you'd like to print the augmentation params, set it as True. Default is False.

    :return (torchvision.transforms.compose): a compose of transformations
