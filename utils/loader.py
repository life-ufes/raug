    """
    This function receives a folder path as parameter and returns three lists containing the path folder's children,the
    list of all images inside these folders, and a possible extra information related to each image. If the images have
    extra information, for example, scalar features, you can load them by setting the extra information suffix. If you
    let it as None, the function will return None for the extra information list.

    Note: the extra information must have the same name of the image. You must inform if you included more characters in
    the name using the extra_info_suf. Check the example below:

    For example, supposing the path's folder has the following tree:
    IMGs
        - A
            img1.png
            img1_feat.txt
            img2.png
            img2_feat.txt
        - B
            img3.png
            img3_feat.txt
            img4.png
            img4_feat.txt
    In this case, root folder is IMGs, its children will be A, B. The return lists will be, first, the list of images,
    which each element will be the image path in the format 'IMGs/{children}/img{number}.png'; second the list of images
    extra information in format 'IMGs/{children}/ext_feat1.txt' (recall that you need to set extra_info_suf="_feat.txt"
    to get these features, if you let it None, the list will also be None); third the children folders's ['A', 'B'].

    Parameters:
    path (string): a string with the root folder's path
    extra_info_suf (string): if the images have extra information, and you wanna load them, set the suffix and extension
    here. Default is None
    img_ext (list): a list of images extension to load. Default is only ['png']
    shuf (bool): if you'd like to shuffle the list of images and extra information path. Dafault is True.

    Returns:
    paths (list): a list of images' paths in all folders
    extra_info (list): a list of images' extra information paths in all folders
    fold_names (list): a list of name of all folders' in the root folder

    This function receives a folder root path and gets all images, labels and a possible extra information for each image
    in the inner folders. It uses the 'get_path_from_folders' function to load the paths. So, the root folder must be
    organized as described in 'get_path_from_folders'.

    The labels generated is based in the root folder's children. For example, if IMGs is the root folder and we have an
    img in 'IMGs/A/img1.png', the label for all images in folder A will be A.

    Parameters:
    path (string): the root folder's path
    extra_info_suf (string): if the images have extra information, and you wanna load them, set the suffix and extension

    n_samples (int): number of samples that you wanna load from the root folder. If None, the function will load all

    columns as the label and path. Everything between it, will be the extra information, which must be numbers (int or

    In addition, if labels_name is informed, the function will load only the images and extra information for these list
